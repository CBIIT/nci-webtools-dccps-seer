          <p>
            JPSurv software was developed to analyze trends in survival with respect to the year of diagnosis [1].
            Survival data includes two time scales that must be taken into consideration: the calendar year of diagnosis
            and the time since diagnosis. The JPSurv model is an extension of the Cox proportional hazards model and of
            Hakulinen and Tenkanen [2] for relative survival. JPSurv fits a proportional hazard joinpoint model to
            survival data on the log hazard scale. Jointpoint models consist of linear segments connected through
            &ldquo;joinpoints,&rdquo; which represent the times at which trends changed. The hazard of cancer death is
            specified as the product of a baseline hazard, on the time since diagnosis scale, and a multiplicative
            factor describing the effect of year of diagnosis and other covariates. The year of diagnosis effect is
            modeled as joined linear segments on the log scale. The number and location of joinpoints are estimated from
            data. The model implies that the probability (hazard) of cancer death as a function of time since diagnosis
            is proportional for subjects diagnosed in different calendar years. The JPSurv software uses discrete-time
            survival data, i.e., data grouped by years since diagnosis in the life table format. The software can
            accommodate both relative survival and cause-specific survival.
          </p>
          <p>
            The purpose of this tutorial is to provide a step-by-step illustration on how to utilize JPSurv to analyze
            changes in survival trends.
          </p>
          <br />
          <h2 className="text-primary">Objective</h2>
          <p>
            The goal is to estimate relative survival trends from 1975 for patients (any sex, any stage) diagnosed with
            Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma (NHL) or Chronic Myeloid Leukemias (CML). Note that we usually donâ€™t select the last
            diagnosis year (2018 in our case) because the last year may miss some of the deaths and survival may be
            overestimated.
          </p>
          <br />
          <h2 className="text-primary">
            Step 1: Extract the data from SEER<sup>*</sup>Stat
          </h2>
          <p>
            JPSurv can read in grouped relative or cause-specific survival data generated from SEER*Stat. The minimum
            variables required are: calendar year of diagnosis, survival time interval (i.e., years from diagnosis),
            number at risk at beginning of interval, number of deaths, number of cases lost to follow-up, and, in the
            case of relative survival, interval expected survival. Data may also include other covariates of interest,
            such as cancer site, sex, stage, etc.

            JPSurv can also read data from delimited text files with common delimiters (comma, semicolon, or tab). Users
            will need to have some prior knowledge of the data stored in each column to correctly use JPSurv. The data
            requires at minimum: calendar year of diagnosis, survival time interval, number at risk at beginning of
            interval, number of deaths, number of cases lost to follow-up, and, in the case of relative survival,
            interval expected survival. Data may also include other covariates of interest, such as cancer site, sex,
            stage, etc. Note that the survival time interval should be at equal intervals and should not have any gaps.
            Note that when using a delimited text file as input to JPSurv, the user must convert the interval expected
            survival column to Proportions from Percentages as the acceptable range of inputs is [0,1].

            JPSurv uses the minimum Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) to select the best fitted model. The Akaike
            Information Criterion (AIC) is also provided. AIC tends to select models with a higher number of joinpoints.

                  <b>Trend measure- Average Absolute Change in Survival by Diagnosis Year:&nbsp;</b>These numbers
                  represent the average absolute difference in survival (either relative or cause-specific) for
                  individuals diagnosed in one calendar year compared to the prior year. This measure depends on
                  calendar year and the time since diagnosis as selected by the user. The average over calendar years is
                  reported.

              <b>Death vs. Year of Diagnosis Graph:</b> The user can select one or more values of death interval years
              and produce the trend graph over all available years of diagnosis. The default is 5-year probability of
              death interval, which represents, given being alive at the end of the fourth year, the probability of
              dying of cancer between the 4<sup>th</sup> and 5<sup>th</sup> year from diagnosis.

                  <b>Trend measure- Percent Change in the Interval Probability of Dying of Cancer by Diagnosis:</b>
                  These numbers represent the percent change in the interval probability of dying of cancer for those
                  diagnosed in one calendar year compared to the prior year. Because the fitted model assumes
                  proportional hazards, this trend measure is independent of time since diagnosis. Thus, it is the same
                  for probabilities of dying in any interval since diagnosis.

              modeled vs. observed survival by years since diagnosis.

            The annotation feature is only available when there are 3 or fewer intervals and models have 3 or fewer
            joinpoints. Model estimates are displayed in terms of the number and location of joinpoints, parameter
            estimates, and standard errors. Data displayed in graphs may be downloaded using the &ldquo;Download Graph
            Dataset&rdquo; option.
