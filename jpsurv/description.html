        <p>The JPSurv software has been developed to analyze trends
        in survival with respect to year at diagnosis. Survival
        data includes two temporal dimensions that are important to
        account for: the calendar year at diagnosis and the time
        since diagnosis. The JPSurv fits a <b>Joinpoint
        survival</b> model to the hazard of cancer death by year at
        diagnosis and assumes a common baseline hazard by time
        since diagnosis. In other words, the probabilities of dying
        at different time interval, e.g., 1 to 2 years, 2 to 3
        years, and 4 to 5 years since diagnosis are proportional
        and share the same join points. The software uses
        discrete-time survival data, i.e. survival data grouped by
        years since diagnosis in the life table format. The
        software accommodates both relative survival and
        cause-specific survival. (Need to check this).</p>

        <p>The JPSurv tool is useful to estimate when and how much
        survival changed over time and to predict survival into the
        future for simulation studies and scenario analyses.</p>
