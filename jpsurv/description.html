        <p>The JPSurv software has been developed to analyze trends
        in survival with respect to year at diagnosis. Survival
        data includes two temporal dimensions that are important to
        account for: the calendar year at diagnosis and the time
        since diagnosis. The JPSurv fits a <b>Joinpoint
        survival </b> model(1) to the hazard of cancer 
        death by year at diagnosis and assumes a common 
        baseline hazard by time since diagnosis. 
        In other words, the probabilities of dying 
        at different time interval, e.g., 0 to 1 year, 
        1 to 2 years, 2 to 3 years, and 4 to 5 years 
        since diagnosis are proportional and share 
        the same joinpoints. The software uses discrete-time survival 
        data, i.e. survival data grouped by years since diagnosis in 
        the life table format. The software accommodates both 
        relative survival and cause-specific survival. </p>

        <p>The JPSurv tool is useful to estimate when and how much 
            survival changed over time and to predict survival 
            into the future for simulation studies and scenario 
            analyses.</p>
