  <h2 class="text-primary">Background</h2>
  <p>
    JPSurv software was developed to analyze trends in survival with respect to
    the year of diagnosis [1]. Survival data includes two time scales that must
    be taken into consideration: the calendar year of diagnosis and the time
    since diagnosis. The JPSurv model is an extension of the Cox proportional
    hazards model and of Hakulinen and Tenkanen [2] for relative survival.
    JPSurv fits a proportional hazard joinpoint model to survival data on the
    log hazard scale. Jointpoint models consist of linear segments connected
    through &ldquo;joinpoints,&rdquo; which represent the times at which trends
    changed. The hazard of cancer death is specified as the product of a
    baseline hazard, on the time since diagnosis scale, and a multiplicative
    factor describing the effect of year of diagnosis and other covariates. The
    year of diagnosis effect is modeled as joined linear segments on the log
    scale. The number and location of joinpoints are estimated from data. The
    model implies that the probability (hazard) of cancer death as a function of
    time since diagnosis is proportional for subjects diagnosed in different
    calendar years. The JPSurv software uses discrete-time survival data, i.e.,
    data grouped by years since diagnosis in the life table format. The software
    can accommodate both relative survival and cause-specific survival.
  </p>
  <p>
    The purpose of this tutorial is to provide a step-by-step illustration on
    how to utilize JPSurv to analyze changes in survival trends.
  </p>
  <br />

  <h2 class="text-primary">Objective</h2>
  <p>
    The goal is to estimate relative survival trends from 1975 for patients (any
    sex, any stage) diagnosed with Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma (NHL) or Chronic Myeloid
    Leukemias (CML). Note that we usually don’t select the last diagnosis year
    (2017 in our case) because the last year may miss some of the deaths and
    survival may be overestimated.
  </p>
  <br />

  <h2 class="text-primary">
    Step 1: Extract the data from SEER<super>*</super>Stat
  </h2>
  <p>
    JPSurv can read in grouped relative or cause-specific survival data
    generated from SEER*Stat. The minimum variables required are: calendar year
    of diagnosis, survival time interval (i.e., years from diagnosis), number at
    risk at beginning of interval, number of deaths, number of cases lost to
    follow-up, and, in the case of relative survival, interval expected
    survival. Data may also include other covariates of interest, such as cancer
    site, sex, stage, etc.

    Data sets generated in SEER*Stat must include year at diagnosis as a
    covariate. To reflect trends in calendar years, 12 months per interval needs
    to be specified. In addition, the &ldquo;Display/Standard Life&rdquo; option
    in the Parameters tab must be checked as JPSurv does not read the
    &ldquo;Summary Table&rdquo; format. Data can be exported directly from
    SEER*Stat and saved as a .txt file with a corresponding dictionary .dic
    file.

    JPSurv can also read data from delimited text files with common delimiters
    (comma, semicolon, or tab). Users will need to have some prior knowledge of
    the data stored in each column to correctly use JPSurv. The data requires at
    minimum: calendar year of diagnosis, survival time interval, number at risk
    at beginning of interval, number of deaths, number of cases lost to
    follow-up, and, in the case of relative survival, interval expected
    survival. Data may also include other covariates of interest, such as cancer
    site, sex, stage, etc. Note that the survival time interval should be at
    equal intervals and should not have any gaps. Note that when using a
    delimited text file as input to JPSurv, the user must convert the interval
    expected survival column to Proportions from Percentages as the acceptable
    range of inputs is [0,1].

    JPSurv uses the minimum Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) to select the
    best fitted model. The Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) is also provided.
    AIC tends to select models with higher number of joinpoints. Graphs and
    other output features are available for other fitted models beyond the final
    selected model.
  </p>
  <p>
    Graphs display predicted (modeled) and observed survival or interval
    probabilities of death for each joinpoint model and cohorts. The default
    model displayed is the final selected model. However, the user can select
    other fitted models. The user can check “Show Trend Measures” and hit
    “Recalculate” to display the trend summary measures. All JPSurv plots are
    created using the ggplot2 R package [3].

      <b>Death vs. Year of Diagnosis Graph:</b> The user can select one or more

      interval, which represents, given being alive at the end of the fourth
      year, the probability of dying of cancer between the 4<sup>th</sup> and

          >
          These numbers represent the percent change in the interval probability
          of dying of cancer for those diagnosed in one calendar year compared
          to the prior year. Because the fitted model assumes proportional
          hazards, this trend measure is independent of time since diagnosis.
          Thus, it is the same for probabilities of dying in any interval since
          diagnosis.
        </li>
      </ul>

  </ul>
  <p>
    For certain graphs, users can display trend measures by checking the box
    “Show Trend Measures.” The annotation feature is only available when there
    are 3 or fewer intervals and models have 3 or fewer joinpoints. Model
    estimates are displayed in terms of the number and location of joinpoints,
