        <p>Joinpoint models characterize trends over calendar time. The joinpoint model consists of linear segments connected through joinpoints. The number and location of joinpoints are estimated from data and represent the times at which trends changed.</p>

        <p>The JPSurv software has been developed to analyze trends in survival with respect to year of diagnosis. Survival data includes two temporal dimensions that are important to consider:  the calendar year of diagnosis and the time since diagnosis. The JPSurv software fits a joinpoint survival model allowing the hazard of cancer death to include joinpoints in the trend for year of diagnosis and assuming a proportional hazards model and a common baseline hazard with respect to time since diagnosis. The software uses discrete-time survival data, i.e. survival data grouped by years since diagnosis in the life table format. The software accommodates both relative survival and cause-specific survival. </p>

        This Beta version of the JPSurv software can only run one joinpoint survival model at a time. Multiple runs will be implemented in the next version. The next sections will describe the input data file, the JPSurv control options for data and model specification, and the JPSurv output produced.

          <p>JPSurv reads grouped relative survival or cause-specific survival data generated from SEER*Stat.</p>

          <p>The data requires at a minimum the following variables: calendar year of diagnosis, survival time interval, number at risk at beginning of interval, number of deaths, and number of cases lost to follow-up, and interval expected survival in the case of relative survival. The data may also include other covariates of interest such as cancer site, sex, stage, etc. </p>
          Tips for creating the survival data in SEER*Stat.
          <ul>
              <li>Year at diagnosis needs to be included as a covariate.</li>
              <li>Make sure the Display/Standard Life option in the Parameters Tab is checked. JPSurv does not read the Summary Table format.</li>
              <li>In order to reflect trends in calendar years, 12 months per interval needs to be specified.</li>

          <p>JPSurv can also read data from delimited text files using common delimiters (comma, semicolon, or tab). The user will need to have prior knowledge of the data stored in each column in order to correctly use the package. 
          The data requires at a minimum the following variables: calendar year of diagnosis, survival time interval, number at risk at beginning of interval, number of deaths, and number of cases lost to follow-up, and interval expected survival in the case of relative survival.

        <ul>
          <li><b>Year of Diagnosis Range:</b>  Specify the number of years that is going to be used to fit the JPSurv model. For example, the data may include diagnosis years from 1975 through 2011, but the user is interested in trends in the last 10 years, e.g. 2002-2011.</li></br>

          <li><b>Cohort Selection:</b>  The current version of JPSurv runs one model at a time, thus the user can only specify 1 value for each of the input variables, e.g. cancer site, sex, stage, etc. A future version will allow users to select multiple variables and fit multiple models.</li></br>

          <li><b>Maximum Number of Joinpoints:</b>  The user can specify the maximum number of joinpoints to be tested. Depending on the number of calendar years and joinpoints the calculation may be slow. Thus for 3 or more joinpoints the calculations are done in a server and an email is sent with a link for the user to retrieve results.</li></br>
          <li><b>Advanced Options:</b></li>
          <ul>
            <li><b>Delete Last Interval:</b>  Last interval can be deleted in case there is data instability in the last follow-up interval.</li>
            <li><b>Minimum Number of Years between Joinpoints (Excluding Joinpoints):</b>  If x is selected joinpoints will be at least x years apart. Default value is 2.</li>
            <li><b>Minimum Number of Years before First Joinpoint (Excluding Joinpoint):</b>  If x is selected the first joinpoint can be located at the (x+1)<sup>th</sup> or later calendar year. Default value is 3.</li>
            <li><b>Minimum Number of Years after Last Joinpoint (Excluding Joinpoint):</b>  If x is selected the last joinpoint can be located at the (x+1)<sup>th</sup> or more calendar years prior to last calendar year. Default value is 5.</li>
            <li><b>Number of Calendar Years of Projected Survival:</b>  Specifies the calculation of projected survival up to x years from the last calendar year. Default value is 5.</li>

          <p><b>Model Selection:</b>  Criteria for assessing goodness of fit for each joinpoint model considered. JPSurv uses the minimum Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) to select a K-joinpoint model where K is between 0 and the maximum number of joinpoints. The Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) is also provided and tends to pick models with a higher number of joinpoints.</p>
          <p><b>Survival Graph/Data:</b>Displays, for each Joinpoint model fit, the predicted and observed cumulative survival by the following.</p>
          <ol>
            <li><b>Year of Diagnosis:</b>  The user can select 1 or more values of <i>interval time since diagnosis</i>, e.g. 5-year or 10-year cumulative survival. The default is 5-year cumulative survival.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Interval Time since Diagnosis:</b>  The user can select one calendar year, e.g. 2000, and show modeled vs. observed survival by years since diagnosis. 
            </li>
          </ol>
            <p><b>Model Estimates:</b>  Displays the number and location of joinpoints, the parameter estimates, and standard errors. </p>
            <p><b>Trend:</b>  Displays 3 summary measures of the trend for each segment between joinpoints: </p>
            <ol>
              <li>Absolute Change in Survival: The difference between survival in the next year minus survival in the given year</li>
              <li>Relative Change in Survival: Change in survival from a given year at diagnosis to the next year <b>relative</b> to the given year.</li>
              <li>Relative Change in Hazard: Change in the hazard of cancer death from a given year at diagnosis to the next year <b>relative</b> to the given year.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>In a segment between 2 joinpoints, trend measures 1 and 2 depend on calendar year, and the average over calendar years is reported. Both of these trend measures also depend on the time since diagnosis as selected by the user. Measure 3 is independent of both calendar year and time since diagnosis.</p>
