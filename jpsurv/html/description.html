        <p>The JPSurv software has been developed to analyze trends in survival with respect to year of diagnosis. The JPSurv software fits a joinpoint survival model allowing the hazard of cancer death to include joinpoints in the trend for year of diagnosis and assuming a proportional hazards model and a common baseline hazard with respect to time since diagnosis. The software uses discrete-time survival data, i.e. survival data grouped by years since diagnosis in the life table format. The software accommodates both relative survival and cause-specific survival.  </p>

        <p>The JPSurv tool is useful for estimating when and how much survival has changed over time and to predict survival into the future for simulation studies and scenario analyses.</p>
